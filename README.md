# Final project | What can cause a heart attack ?

### Introduction

For this project, I wanted to focus on a health problem: the occurrence of heart attacks and the main risk factors.
To do this, I used a dataset from the US Center for disease control and prevention, listing the answers to a questionnaire from over 400.000 people living in the united states.

### Cleaning

After studying the dataset description (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2021/pdf/codebook21_llcp-v2-508.pdf), I decided to select 27 features from the 303 columns and I removed all the unknown values to be as precises as possible. I ended up with arround 250.000 records.

### Analysis

I then analyzed the risk factors from different points of view:
- the respondents' antecedents
- lifestyle habits
- socio-economic aspects

### Scraping

Next, I scraped the different symptoms of heart attack and cardiovascular disease.

### Modeling

After that, I built a model to predict the occurrence or not of a heart attack.
